==Directory Structure==
This 583 project consists of two main optimizations to CDI. (1) The function cloning optimization, and (2) the sled reordering optimization. Both are given their own subtree in the folder directory, with their own code and results folders. "code" folders contain all the code necessary to build and run the optimization's transformation program. "results" folders contain the result CSVs of these optimizations, as well as links to online google-sheets documents for easier viewing of the data.
